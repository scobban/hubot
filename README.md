initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

Get Kitt up and running using:

## Commands

You will receive a response from Kitt if you direct message or mention @kitt any of the following commands:

```

hello
band name

Additionally, @kitt will also respond if you say "pizza" anywhere in Slack.

## The Future
